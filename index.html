        <p>
            Art is an ephemeral escape for my mind that heals, reconstructs and improves me in ways people may not understand. From the ages of 9 to 17, many of my classmates abused or bullied me but not in the stereotypical physical aspect of threats for lunch money or things of that sort, but rather an attack upon my own psyche.  The constant battering of my identity became too confusing and overwhelming that I started to consider their remarks as true. That moment shattered my identity so completely that in order to protect myself I shunned everyone in my life, out of either shame or disgust because I did not know who I was anymore, and I could not handle any more people ridiculing me for who I was or might be later on in life. So, I used art as a therapeutic outlet for my depression and an escape from my current reality. Art allowed me to create these fantasy worlds where I could draw myself empowered, where I could be completely myself without anyoneâ€™s judgment because they could never understand me. But the booming gaming culture was the amazing pivotal point where I could see my art fuse into this digital environment to create an entirely new identity for myself.

    Gaming culture has been one of the driving forces in my art and my life. Being able to create a 'digital-self' in a whole new reality was something of a god send for me, yet at the same time desensitized me from my own surroundings. From consoles such as N64 to PS4, and also PC, all the gaming environments could let me be the person I had always wanted to be, so I had no need to be present in actual reality when I had everything I wanted in the gaming world. Yet as I grew older, I realized that this way of life never helped the problems I had and only created more identities that added to my confusion. Therefore, these past 5 years I've been soul searching and trying to find myself again. As an artist, I really want to express digital identities and hyperreality to my audience to make them aware of the complexity and danger of technology. As of now, I'm working with quite a few different mediums that revolve around game culture and identity (most notably the game World of Warcraft), just to get a feel for and experiment with different possibilities from visual effects, video, and programming, as well as, sculpture, painting and drawing.
