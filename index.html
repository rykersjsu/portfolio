        <p>
           Identity is the core aspect of our humanity, in essence it would be considered  parts of our soul or the accumulation of memories both past and present that collide together under many different influences that express who we are. Taking these portions of ourselves and abstracting these narratives of our identity has always been a conceptual interest within my artwork. Whether that takes on the form of architectural space, the use of vibrancy in color to evoke emotion, or cultural references within both 2D illustration to 3D modeling; I’ve always tried to use my artistic expression to question societies proclivities of social and political agendas. The beauty that I see within using conceptual ideas of identity as a means to discuss or debate the different categories regarding social activism is that one’s sense of self is a lifelong journey; identity continuously flows down many different paths, builds itself on new thought processes or ideas which can lead to a changed or evolved  sense of perspective towards the same or opposing rationale. By using and abstracting imagery such as particular environments or representational forms, the viewer can create a connection of that space and by doing so recall memories to infer upon both time and experiences without having too much information so that they can question their own sense of identity within the artwork.

When I first began my exploration into the art world, it was during my youth when I first took to art as a form of escapism from both the physical and mental bullying which I had to unfortunately deal with. Being able to express oneself through the use of ink, graphite or paint was therapeutic because of the control I had over my own narrative; it allowed me to abstract parts of my identity to keep its truth hidden for my own safety yet at the same time it gave me a voice to speak out defiantly towards those that oppressed me. When the internet came into fruition this also drastically altered my perspective on identity, because of the anonymity it provided for users, one could be someone entirely different and nobody would know the wiser. The digital landscape became a powerful tool to subvert social structure and became a universally open platform for change.  My artwork moved from fantastical drawings of new undiscovered landscapes to using virtual environments to create self representation or avatars as well as film that uses visual effects to portray supernatural beings evolving from humans. Some of my work such as “Two Of A Kind” and the “Arrcho” series uses motion tracking to overlay special visual effects that change or abstract the body, furthermore both use specific locations whether that was created in Maya or shot on site that delve into my personal identity and trauma that occurred; sort of symbolizing confronting and coming to terms with those spaces and becoming stronger from it.
